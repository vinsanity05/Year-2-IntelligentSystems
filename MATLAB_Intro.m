% Hello, my name is Vince Verdadero, i have done the MATLAB onramp and
% earned my certificate!
% Throughout the MATLAB onramp intro, I have learnt:
% To Enter commands in MATLAB to perform calculations and create variables.
% Write and save your own MATLAB programs.
% Create MATLAB variables that contain multiple elements.
% Use indexing to extract and modify rows, columns, and elements of MATLAB 
% arrays.
% Perform calculations on entire arrays at once.
% Call functions to obtain multiple outputs.
% Use the MATLAB documentation to discover information about MATLAB 
% features.
% Visualize variables using MATLAB's plotting functions.
% Import data from external files
% Use logical expressions to help you to extract elements of interest from
% MATLAB arrays.
% Write programs that execute code based upon some condition.
